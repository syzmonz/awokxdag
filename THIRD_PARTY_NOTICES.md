## Piglet — Hamspiced

Fleet Wardrive's explicit coordinator/node ESP-NOW topology was informed by
[Piglet](https://github.com/Hamspiced/piglet) by **Hamspiced**. Piglet's
Core/Node behavior provided the reference for keeping a user-selected Core
authoritative while nodes discover, join, heartbeat, and reconnect.

AxD's fleet wire protocol, roster and channel assignment, row aggregation,
display UI, and web integration are implemented for AxD; Piglet source code was
not copied into this repository. Piglet is distributed under the
[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International
license](https://github.com/Hamspiced/piglet/blob/main/LICENSE). Thanks to
Hamspiced for publishing Piglet and its ESP-NOW design openly.

## ESP32 Marauder — justcallmekoko

AxD's direct wardrive upload workflow references ESP32 Marauder's documented
network/file/destination flow and SD credential-file convention. AxD consolidates
the credentials into its own `wardrive_upload.txt` format; its screen, multipart
streaming client, TLS validation, response handling, and audit integration are
newly implemented for AxD, and no uploader source body was copied.

[ESP32 Marauder](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder) is maintained
by **justcallmekoko (Justin Hazard)** and distributed under GPL-3.0. Thanks for
publishing the hardware mappings, radio lifecycle work, and direct-upload user
workflow that informed this firmware.

## Evil-M5Project — 7h30th3r0n3

The Network Tools and Flipper-like BLE service hints reference the feature designs
in [Evil-Cardputer-v1-5-5.ino](https://github.com/7h30th3r0n3/Evil-M5Project/blob/main/Evil-Cardputer-v1-5-5.ino),
reviewed on 2026-09-11. Relevant sections include `scanHosts`, `scanPorts`, the
CCTV toolkit, `detectPrinter`, `sipScan`, `listUPnPMappings`, and Wall of Flippers.
Thanks to **7h30th3r0n3** for making that work available.

AWOKxDAG's network engine, parsers, and UI integration are newly written for this
firmware. Upstream scanner function bodies were not copied. Advertised BLE service
UUIDs serve as protocol identification hints. Evil-M5's `scanPorts` section credits
[pr3y/Bruce](https://github.com/pr3y/bruce); that section was not transplanted.
