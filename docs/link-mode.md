# Link Mode

Two AxD units pair over ESP-NOW and can run **Split Wardrive**: they
divide the channel list so each board scans a different part of the spectrum.

Reached from **GPS → Drive modes → Split**, or serial `n`. Wi-Fi-only in this release; BLE is
kept off so ESP-NOW is not torn down on Mini boards.

## Pairing

1. Open Split on both units and select **Pair boards**.
2. Each board broadcasts a HELLO on channel 1. Discovery is plaintext; ESP-NOW
   cannot encrypt broadcast.
3. Both screens show the same 4-digit confirm code, derived from the unordered
   pair of MAC addresses. Nothing is typed.
4. Tap **Confirm** on each unit. The lower MAC becomes master and owns the
   session id and clock.
5. After pairing, SYNC/TELEM move to an encrypted unicast peer (PMK + per-pair
   LMK baked into the firmware). Anyone with the binary can derive those keys;
   encryption only stops casual sniffing.

Cancel pairing from the Link screen, or serial **h** from Home, to stop HELLO
broadcasts. Unpair from the paired idle screen. Serial **h** does not unpair a
finished session.

## Protocol

Control frames use the `LinkPacket` POD in `link_protocol.h` (36 bytes on every
supported ABI); file and dashboard messages use their own bounded structs. Magic `AWKL`, **protocol version 2** on all boards. Version 1
C5 units from 1.2.0 will not pair with 1.3.0+; reflash both sides.

HELLO flags advertise dual-band capability (`kLinkFlagDualBand`). Band
capability is *not* encoded in the version number; 1.3.0 made the version
uniform so a C5 and a classic 2.4 GHz board can pair.

## Split Wardrive

- Two matching units **alternate-deal** the shared plan (even/odd indices).
  Two C5s split the full dual-band list; two classic boards split 2.4 GHz.
- A mixed C5 + 2.4 GHz pair **splits by band**: the C5 takes all of 5 GHz, the
  classic board takes all of 2.4 GHz, with no overlap.
- A one-second rendezvous on channel 1 exchanges telemetry. Each screen shows
  its own session counts and recording/GPS health, with partner AP count,
  link RSSI, and a partner-lost alert on Touch. Mini keeps a compact summary.
- Each board writes a new WiGLE `wardrive-NNNN.csv` per Start and geotags from
  its own GPS.
- Started unpaired, Link Mode wardrives every assigned channel solo.

## Fleet Wardrive

Open **GPS → Drive modes → Fleet**, then choose **Start as coordinator** or
**Join as worker**. Reopening a running mode returns to its dashboard. The
mode picker requires stopping/leaving another active session (or cancelling
pairing) before changing modes; it never silently replaces one. A stopped
Split pair must be unpaired before starting a Fleet.

- Exactly one member is dedicated to BLE scanning.
- Classic v1-v3 Touch/Mini WROOM workers own and evenly split 2.4 GHz.
- When classic workers are present, C5 Wi-Fi workers own and evenly split 5 GHz.
- In an all-C5 fleet, the Wi-Fi workers evenly split the full dual-band plan.
- Band pools use independent modulo slices, so no two Wi-Fi workers receive the
  same channel.

See `AWOKxDAG/link.ino` for the state machine.

## Dashboard and verified SD transfers

`AxdWardriveStatusMsg` carries versioned `$WDSTAT,1,...` telemetry (source,
session, active state, elapsed seconds, metres, GPS fix coverage, Wi-Fi/BLE
counts, recent rate, satellites/HDOP, storage state, rows/bytes, flush age,
local time/zone, filename, mode, current fix/speed, node count). The bridge
forwards it as BLE result source 10. Existing status/rendezvous opportunities
send it without changing scanner channels. Storage state reports SD API results;
it is not a guarantee against power loss.

Verified Bluetooth file requests use opcode 70: op/index/target followed by
little-endian uint32 token, start sequence, snapshot byte length, and CRC32
(19 bytes). Sequence zero requests a new snapshot. Resume uses the first
missing sequence and original size/CRC; sequence total+1 requests completion
only. The relayed command stores these fields in sessionId, masterMillis,
networks, and bleCount respectively. Both chips and the web client need support.

File chunks retain the existing token/sequence/browser-ACK protocol. Kind 3 is
the manifest (sequence 0xffffffff), kind 5 is hash progress (0xfffffffe), and
kind 4 is verified completion (total+1). Manifest/completion data is eight
hexadecimal CRC32 digits followed by a comma and filename. Kind 0 remains data
and kind 2 remains an error. CRC32 checks accidental corruption, not authenticity.
The browser retains partial chunks only while its tab remains open.
